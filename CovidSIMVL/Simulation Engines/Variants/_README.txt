 These exist to serve custom purposes
 
1. Fixed Univ with AgeRisks - archived version of single universe with built-in age risks following Cdn demographics
2. Fixing NaN error - multiverse version backup to current PRIMARY CovidSIMVL
3. FastForward Vaccinations - this is for skipping 14 days of 0% protection after jab1 and starts with jab2
       however, this means that the initial transmitter has to build up descendants whereas in the full jab1-jab2
	   case, there are numerous simultaneous transmitters by day 14 when resistance kicks in, so the comparability
	   is weakened because not only are there no infected before jab2 in FF, but in the FF+ days, the thetas
	   will be larger for FF than for normal....so this has biases toward more survivors
	   
4. Territory and Footprint - no viral model, just study of stochastic movements resulting from mF and to a lesser
   extent, HzR in trying to get standard population DENSITY model ie persons to area so that when k persons move into
   arena 800x600 and we want the infection risks to be similar to a more populated arena, we know how to set the
   mF and HzR....if we want equivalence....it may be that when 5 persons instead of 50 persons move into a space, the
   implicit probability SHOULD be less...
   
   However, in the case of U.HOME we have lots of persons crowded into U.HOME but only family members infect one
   another, and we do not know how to set the mF and HzR so they infect one another at a probability equivalent to
   what we would like - which is what?
   
   That is what motivates this study
